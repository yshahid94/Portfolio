        <h2>Game of Life</h2>
        <p class="text-left">Game of life was my dissertation project in university, the project helped me get to grips with architecting a solution. 
          There are a few different problems that need to be tackled and itâ€™s a fun puzzle. 
          Although I did have to code the original in Java which made it less fun. 
          This is not really the type of thing Vue is made for but when I originally picked up Vue this gave me a good way to learn the basics in a fun way. </p>
